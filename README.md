This is the first program of my daily code challenge

Write a JavaScript program to generate a random number and store it in a variable.
The program then takes input from the user to tell them whether the guess was correct, greater than, or lesser than the original number.
100 - (no of guesses) is the score of the user.
The program is expected to terminate once the number is guessed.
The number should be between 1 and 100.
